The idea behind navmeshes is simple: Instead of building a graph of waypoints to represent the paths an actor can take to get from one place to another, we build a mesh that represents the area where an actor is allowed to walk. Since I'm quite happy with the way my implementation turned out, here is a quick description of how I generate my navmeshes from the level geometry in 2D using Clipper and Poly2Tri.

在寻路网格中我们还会要求每个多边形都必须是凸多边形，这样才能保证角色在行进中不会穿过网格。
